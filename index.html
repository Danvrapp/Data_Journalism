          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income, & poverty level</h2>
          <h3>Health risks vs. poverty</h3>
          <p>When weighing poverty vs. the health risks measured, there appears to be a consistent, although slight,
            positive coorelation.  I would hypothesize this goes along with the idea that a lower income is tied to
            a lower education level, therefore not knowing and understanding the risks involed in being obese & smoking.
            Lower income families tend to eat a less nutrious diet, and eat a diet higher in carbs, fat, & sugar.
          </p>

          <h3>Health risks vs. age</h3>
          <p>When weighing age vs. the health risks measured, I see no obvious, apparent trends.  This does not
            surprise me, as age groups encompass all walks of life and all socio-economic backgrounds.  
          </p>

          <h3>Health risks vs. income</h3>
          <p>When weighing income vs. the health risks measured, there appears to be a negative coorelation with 
            smoking and obesity.  Again, this does not surprise me, and I would hypothesize this is because higher
            income most likely follows higher education levels, where individuals would know and have a better
            understanding of the negative effects of smoking and obesity.  What I do find surprising is there 
            appears to be no coorelation--and definitely no positive coorelation--between income and percentage of
            invividuals having healthcare.
